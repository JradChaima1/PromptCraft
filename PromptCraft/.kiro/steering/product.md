# Product Overview

## AI-Powered 2D Sandbox Building Game

A creative sandbox game built with Phaser 3 that enables players to generate custom pixel art assets using AI (Pollinations API) and build interactive 2D worlds. Players can:

- Generate pixel art assets from text prompts (characters, objects, terrain, decorations, buildings)
- Place, transform, and arrange assets in a physics-enabled world
- Save and load worlds with full persistence
- Export/import worlds for sharing
- Control a player character with platformer physics

The game emphasizes creative freedom with no strict objectives, allowing players to build whatever they imagine using AI-generated content.

## Core Features
